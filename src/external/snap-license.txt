10	      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

32	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
33	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
34	      and conversions to other media types.
35
36	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
37	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
38	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
39	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
40
41	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
42	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
43	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
44	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
45	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
46	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
47	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
48
49	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
50	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
51	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
52	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
53	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
54	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
55	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
56	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
57	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
58	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
59	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

61	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
62
63	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
64	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
65	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
66
67	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
68	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
69	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
70	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
71	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
72	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
73
74	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
75	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
76	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
77	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
78	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
79	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
80	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
81	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
82	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
83	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
84	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
85	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
86	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
87	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
88	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
89
90	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
91	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
92	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
93	      meet the following conditions:
94
95	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
96	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
97
98	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
99	          stating that You changed the files; and
100
101	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
102	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
103	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
104	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
105	          the Derivative Works; and
106
107	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
108	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
109	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
110	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
111	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
112	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
113	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
114	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
115	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
116	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
117	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
118	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
119	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
120	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
121	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
122	          as modifying the License.
123
124	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
125	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
126	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
127	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
128	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
129	      the conditions stated in this License.
130
131	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
132	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
133	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
134	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
135	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
136	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
137	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
138
139	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
140	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
141	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
142	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
143
144	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
145	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
146	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
147	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
148	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
149	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
150	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
151	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
152	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
153
154	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
155	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
156	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
157	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
158	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
159	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
160	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
161	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
162	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
163	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
164	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
165
166	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
167	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
168	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
169	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
170	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
171	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
172	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
173	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
174	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
175	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
176
